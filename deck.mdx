# Async Testing

_"sprinkle some time on it"_

---

# Async can be difficult

- Time
- Learning curve
- Not intuitive
- Leads to non-deterministic (flaky) tests

---

# Flaky tests are not useful

> "Non-deterministic tests have two problems, firstly they are useless, secondly they are a virulent infection that can completely ruin your entire test suite."

- Martin Fowler

---

# Common mistakes

- Not returning promises, from tests or actions etc.
- Conditional expectations
- Missing `expect.assertions`
- Random timeouts
- Code generated tests

---

# Avoiding mistakes

- Use `npm run test-strict` during development
- It'll catch tests without assertions and broken promises
- ESLint

---

# Dealing with time

- What is async? Understand the rules
- Control
- Simplify
- Observe

# Use the spec to your advantage

- When mocking network is prefered
- Isolated (unit) tests
- TDD
- The fetch logic is simple and not likely to change
- Pretty much always improtant

# Redux ledger

- Actions cause other async actions and so on (cascade)

# When all else fails...

- You got a mess of code to deal with
- The logic is impossible to shim (Apollo)
- The logic is brittle and you need coverage to refactor
- Maybe you simply want to sanity check your initial approach?
